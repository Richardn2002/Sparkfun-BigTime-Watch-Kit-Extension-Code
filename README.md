#NOTICE:'RICHARD20020815' AND 'RICHARDN' ARE MY TWO NAMES,SO 'COPYRIGHT (C) RICHARD20020815' EQUALS TO 'COPYRIGHT(C) RICHARDN'

the original code is written by Nathan Seidle under a modified Beerware license :

This project is forked with permission from Spikenzie labs' Solder:Time kit that is not open source. We really wanted to make the watch kits easier to hack so we combine the two ICs (a PIC and an RTC) into one (the ATmega328). We also rewrote all the code in C/Arduino so that it is easier to maintain and hack. We also reduced the current consumption so that you should get an estimated 2 years of run time on a single CR2032 cell!

i modified it,that is,added and deleted something to add some fun to sparkfun watchkit (BigTime Watch Kit (KIT-11178))

the code i added is under MIT license,and you can use it freely without removing my name

and 

if you use it
you must think my girlfriend is cute and pretty and clever if you meet us in the street someday(if i get a girlfriend someday)

download it and upload the code to your own watch
and show off!
